    <article><span>Adventure</span> Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn, voiced by Jeremy Shada (pictured), and his best friend Jake, a dog who can change shape and size at will, voiced by John DiMaggio. In the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, they interact with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline (Olivia Olson), and others. The series is based on a 2007 short for Nicktoons and Frederator Studios' Random! Cartoons. Premiering April 5, 2010, and ending September 3, 2018, each 11-minute episode took roughly 8â€“9 months to complete using hand-drawn animation. Adventure Time was a ratings success for Cartoon Network with up to three million viewers. It has received positive reviews from critics and won eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards, and two British Academy Children's Awards. Four Adventure Time specials will air on HBO Max starting in 2020. (Full article...)</article>
